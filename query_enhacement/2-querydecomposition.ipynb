    "### 🧠 What is Query Decomposition?\n",
    "Query decomposition is the process of taking a complex, multi-part question and breaking it into simpler, atomic sub-questions that can each be retrieved and answered individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Why Use Query Decomposition?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex queries often involve multiple concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs or retrievers may miss parts of the original question\n",
    "\n",
    "- It enables multi-hop reasoning (answering in steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows parallelism (especially in multi-agent frameworks)"

      "✅ Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is the role of memory in LangChain's system?\n",
      "A: The role of memory in LangChain's system is to allow the LLM (Language Model) to maintain awareness of previous conversation turns and summarize long interactions to fit within token limits. Memory modules like ConversationBufferMemory and ConversationSummaryMemory are used for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does LangChain utilize agents in its operations?\n",
      "A: LangChain utilizes agents in its operations by employing a planner-executor model, where the agent plans out a sequence of tool invocations to achieve a goal. This includes dynamic decision-making, branching logic, and context-aware memory use across steps. The agents use LLMs to reason about which tool to call, what input to provide, and how to process the output. They can execute multi-step tasks and integrate with tools like web search, calculators, and code execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is the role of memory in CrewAI's system?\n",
      "A: The role of memory in CrewAI's system is to enable agents to share context, communicate dynamically with one another, and contribute meaningfully to the overall crew objective. Memory allows agents to remember their purpose, goal, and set of tools, ensuring that they stay on task and collaborate effectively within the framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does CrewAI utilize agents in its operations?\n",
      "A: CrewAI utilizes agents by defining them with a purpose, a goal, and a set of tools they can use. Each agent has a specific role within a crew, such as researcher, planner, or executor, and operates semi-independently within a collaborative context. The framework ensures that each agent stays on task and contributes meaningfully to the overall crew objective.\n"
